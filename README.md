## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to evaluate the security posture of an organization's network and systems using Python. It also focuses on threat intelligence analysis, utilizing various tools and libraries to collect, process, and analyze security data, providing actionable insights for enhancing security measures.

This project aims to automate and streamline the process of security evaluation and threat intelligence collection, thereby improving the overall cybersecurity posture of an organization. It can help security analysts, IT professionals, and cybersecurity teams to make informed decisions regarding security vulnerabilities and potential threats.

## Key Features
# Security Posture Evaluation

Identifies security gaps in a system or network.
Evaluates network vulnerabilities and risks.
Generates security reports for analysis.

# hreat Intelligence Analysis
Collects and processes threat intelligence data (such as IP addresses, domains, etc.).
Identifies potential malicious activities using threat intelligence feeds.
Detects and analyzes common attack patterns and trends.

# Automated Threat Detection
Uses Python libraries to automate threat intelligence gathering.
Scans network traffic for suspicious activities or indicators of compromise (IoC).

# Reporting and Visualization
Generates visualizations and reports on security posture and threats.
Provides actionable insights for security improvements.

# Technologies Used
Python
The project is implemented in Python, using various libraries for network analysis, threat intelligence collection, and security evaluation.

# Libraries

requests: For handling API requests to threat intelligence providers.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib/seaborn: For data visualization.
scapy: For network traffic analysis.
whois: For domain analysis and information retrieval.
pyshark: For capturing and analyzing network packets.
Other Tools

Threat Intelligence APIs (such as AlienVault OTX, VirusTotal, and others).
Web scraping tools for gathering threat data.
Security information and event management (SIEM) systems for real-time monitoring.

Usage Instructions

# Security Posture Evaluation:
Run the script posture_evaluation.py to evaluate the security posture of a network or system.

# Example command:
python posture_evaluation.py
Threat Intelligence Analysis:
To analyze threat intelligence data, run threat_intelligence.py.

Example command:
python threat_intelligence.py --ip 192.168.1.1
Visualization and Reporting:
The system will automatically generate security posture and threat analysis reports.
Reports will be saved in the reports/ folder.
